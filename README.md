DeSRTO
==
This is a tool I wrote when I was a Ph.D. student.
It is used to identify Spurious TCP retransmission timeout (SRTO) given two CAP traces captured on the two endpoints of a TCP connection.

This tool is described in the following paper:

[Antonio Barbuzzi, Gennaro Boggia, and Luigi Alfredo Grieco, "DeSRTO: an effective algorithm for SRTO detection in TCP connections", Proc. of Traffic Monitoring and Analysis Workshop, TMA, Zurich, Switzerland, Apr., 2010 ] (docs/desrto.pdf)

I'll leave the original code as it is - maybe unpolished, and with the original README.
